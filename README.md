# Exercise 6 - Data analysis with Pandas

In this week's exercise we will continue developing our skills using Pandas to analyze climate data.

The aim of this exercise is to analyze historical weather data and weather anomalies. In Problem 1 you read in a tricky data file and explore it's contents. In problem 2, you will convert and aggregate the data from daily temperatures in Fahrenheit, to monthly average temperatures in Celsius. 
- **Exercise 6 is due by the start of the next lesson (9:00 am, 24 May 2021)**.

## Input data
For problems 1-3 in this exercise we will be using historical climate data from the Helsinki-Vantaa airport station. For these problems, we have daily observations obtained from the NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network. The file was downloaded using the "Custom GHCN-Daily Text" output format, including following attributes:

| Attribute                | Description                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `STATION`                | Unique ID of the weather station |
| `ELEVATION`              | Elevation of the station         |
| `LATITUDE` , `LONGITUDE` | Coordinates of the station       |
| `DATE`                   | Date of the measurement          |
| `PRCP`                   | Precipitation                    |
| `TAVG`                   | Average temperature              |
| `TMAX`                   | Maximum temperature              |
| `TMIN`                   | Minimum temperature              |

Note: once again that temperatures in this dataset are given in degrees Fahrenheit.
